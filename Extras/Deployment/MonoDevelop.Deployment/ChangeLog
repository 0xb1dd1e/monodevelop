	  source project in the deploy file constructor.
	* MonoDevelop.Deployment/UnknownPackageBuilder.cs,
	  MonoDevelop.Deployment/InstallResolver.cs,
	  BinariesZipEditorWidget.cs: Track api changes.

	  Changed order of steps in the package creation wizard.
	* MonoDevelop.Deployment.Gui/DeployDialog.cs: Changed the order of some
	  steps. The first step is now selecting the package type, and the
	  second step is selecting the projects/solutions to include in the
	  package.
	* MonoDevelop.Deployment.Gui/EditPackageDialog.cs,
	  MonoDevelop.Deployment.Gui/DeployFileListWidget.cs: Added a new
	  view which shows the list of files to be deployed.
