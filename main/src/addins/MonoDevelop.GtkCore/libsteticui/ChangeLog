	* LibraryCache.cs: Avoid recursive loading of
	  AssemblyDefinition. Rely on cache info to check if a
	  referenced library contains widget definitions.

	* AssemblyResolver.cs: Make sure the resolver returns full
	  paths.

	* CecilWidgetLibrary.cs: Use the full path to query info from
	  the cache. Properly unsubscribe the Changed event from the
	  cache. Resolve assemblies using the provided assembly
	  resolver.

	* ApplicationBackend.cs:
	* AssemblyWidgetLibrary.cs: From now on the registry and the
	  library cache only handle libraries with full paths.

	* Project.cs: Make sure unused project backends are properly
	  disposed.

	* libsteticui.csproj: Flush.

	* PropertyTree.cs:
	* WidgetDesignerBackend.cs: Dispose Gdk cursors, else
	  finalisers destroy them outside of the GUI thread and often
	  crash MD due to X asserts resulting in _XCBUnlockDisplay
	  errors.

	* libsteticui.csproj: Don't build with make, since MD can
	  build these just fine.

	* libsteticui.csproj: Allow unsafe code, since Shadow.cs has
	  unsafe code.

	* libsteticui.mdp:
	* libsteticui.csproj: Migrated to MSBuild file format.
